        <a name="1">Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,</a><br>
        <a name="2">Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.</a><br>
        <a name="3">Even like a man new haled from the rack,</a><br>
        <a name="4">So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.</a><br>
        <a name="5">And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,</a><br>
        <a name="6">Nestor-like aged in an age of care,</a><br>
        <a name="7">Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.</a><br>
        <a name="8">These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,</a><br>
        <a name="9">Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;</a><br>
        <a name="10">Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,</a><br>
        <a name="11">And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine</a><br>
        <a name="12">That droops his sapless branches to the ground;</a><br>
        <a name="13">Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,</a><br>
        <a name="14">Unable to support this lump of clay,</a><br>
        <a name="15">Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,</a><br>
        <a name="16">As witting I no other comfort have.</a><br>
        <a name="17">But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?</a><br>
        </blockquote>

        <a name="speech2"><b>First Gaoler</b></a>
        <blockquote>
        <a name="18">Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:</a><br>
        <a name="19">We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber;</a><br>
        <a name="20">And answer was return'd that he will come.</a><br>
        </blockquote>

        <a name="speech3"><b>MORTIMER</b></a>
        <blockquote>
        <a name="21">Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.</a><br>
        <a name="22">Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.</a><br>
        <a name="23">Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,</a><br>
        <a name="24">Before whose glory I was great in arms,</a><br>
        <a name="25">This loathsome sequestration have I had:</a><br>
        <a name="26">And even since then hath Richard been obscured,</a><br>
        <a name="27">Deprived of honour and inheritance.</a><br>
        <a name="28">But now the arbitrator of despairs,</a><br>
        <a name="29">Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,</a><br>
        <a name="30">With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:</a><br>
        <a name="31">I would his troubles likewise were expired,</a><br>
        <a name="32">That so he might recover what was lost.</a><br>
        <p><i>Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET</i></p>

        <a name="40">O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,</a><br>
        <a name="41">That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.</a><br>
        <a name="42">And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,</a><br>

        <a name="46">And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.</a><br>
        <a name="47">This day, in argument upon a case,</a><br>
        <a name="48">Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;</a><br>
        <a name="49">Among which terms he used his lavish tongue</a><br>
        <a name="50">And did upbraid me with my father's death:</a><br>
        <a name="51">Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,</a><br>
        <a name="52">Else with the like I had requited him.</a><br>
        <a name="53">Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,</a><br>
        <a name="54">In honour of a true Plantagenet</a><br>
        <a name="55">And for alliance sake, declare the cause</a><br>
        <a name="56">My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.</a><br>

        <a name="58">And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth</a><br>
        <a name="59">Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,</a><br>
        <a name="60">Was cursed instrument of his decease.</a><br>
        <a name="61">RICHARD</a><br>
