        <h3>The First part of King Henry the Sixth</h3>
        <h4>Act 2, Scene 5: The Tower of London</h4>

        <p class="stage-direction">Enter MORTIMER, brought in a chair, and Gaolers</p>

        <h5 class="name mortimer">MORTIMER</h5>
        <p class="speech mortimer">Kind keepers of my weak decaying age, <br>
        Let dying Mortimer here rest himself. <br>
        Even like a man new haled from the rack, <br>
        So fare my limbs with long imprisonment. <br>
        And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death, <br>
        Nestor-like aged in an age of care, <br>
        Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer. <br>
        These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent, <br>
        Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent; <br>
        Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief, <br>
        And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine <br>
        That droops his sapless branches to the ground; <br>
        Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb, <br>
        Unable to support this lump of clay, <br>
        Swift-winged with desire to get a grave, <br>
        As witting I no other comfort have. <br>
        But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?</p>

        <h5 class="name first-gaoler">First Gaoler</h5>
        <p class="speech first-gaoler">Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come: <br>
        We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber; <br>
        And answer was return'd that he will come.</p>

        <h5 class="name mortimer">MORTIMER</h5>
        <p class="speech mortimer">Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied. <br>
        Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine. <br>
        Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign, <br>
        Before whose glory I was great in arms, <br>
        This loathsome sequestration have I had: <br>
        And even since then hath Richard been obscured, <br>
        Deprived of honour and inheritance. <br>
        But now the arbitrator of despairs, <br>
        Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries, <br>
        With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence: <br>
        I would his troubles likewise were expired, <br>
        That so he might recover what was lost.</p>
        <p class="stage-direction">Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET</p>

        <h5 class="name first-gaoler">First Gaoler</h5>
        <p class="speech first-gaoler">My lord, your loving nephew now is come.</p>

        <h5 class="name mortimer">MORTIMER</h5>
        <p class="speech mortimer">Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come? <br>
        RICHARD</p>

        <h5 class="name plantagenet">PLANTAGENET</h5>
        <p class="speech plantagenet">Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used, <br>
        Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.</p>

        <h5 class="name mortimer">MORTIMER</h5>
        <p class="speech mortimer">Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck, <br>
        And in his bosom spend my latter gasp: <br>
        O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks, <br>
        That I may kindly give one fainting kiss. <br>
        And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock, <br>
        Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised? <br>
        RICHARD</p>

        <h5 class="name plantagenet">PLANTAGENET</h5>
        <p class="speech plantagenet">First, lean thine aged back against mine arm; <br>
        And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease. <br>
        This day, in argument upon a case, <br>
        Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me; <br>
        Among which terms he used his lavish tongue <br>
        And did upbraid me with my father's death: <br>
        Which obloquy set bars before my tongue, <br>
        Else with the like I had requited him. <br>
        Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake, <br>
        In honour of a true Plantagenet <br>
        And for alliance sake, declare the cause <br>
        My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.</p>

        <h5 class="name mortimer">MORTIMER</h5>
        <p class="speech mortimer">That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me <br>
        And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth <br>
        Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine, <br>
        Was cursed instrument of his decease. <br>
        RICHARD</p>

        <h5 class="name plantagenet">PLANTAGENET</h5>
        <p class="speech plantagenet">Discover more at large what cause that was, <br>
        For I am ignorant and cannot guess.</p>
