        <h5 class="name mortimer">MORTIMER</h5>
        <p class="speech mortimer">I will, if that my fading breath permit <br>
        And death approach not ere my tale be done. <br>
        Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king, <br>
        Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son, <br>
        The first-begotten and the lawful heir, <br>
        Of Edward king, the third of that descent: <br>
        During whose reign the Percies of the north, <br>
        Finding his usurpation most unjust, <br>
        Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne: <br>
        The reason moved these warlike lords to this <br>
        Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed, <br>
        Leaving no heir begotten of his body-- <br>
        I was the next by birth and parentage; <br>
        For by my mother I derived am <br>
        From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son <br>
        To King Edward the Third; whereas he <br>
        From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree, <br>
        Being but fourth of that heroic line. <br>
        But mark: as in this haughty attempt <br>
        They laboured to plant the rightful heir, <br>
        I lost my liberty and they their lives. <br>
        Long after this, when Henry the Fifth, <br>
        Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign, <br>
        Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived <br>
        From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York, <br>
        Marrying my sister that thy mother was, <br>
        Again in pity of my hard distress <br>
        Levied an army, weening to redeem <br>
        And have install'd me in the diadem: <br>
        But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl <br>
        And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers, <br>
        In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd. <br>
        RICHARD</p>

        <h5 class="name plantagenet">PLANTAGENET</h5>
        <p class="speech plantagenet">Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.</p>

        <h5 class="name mortimer">MORTIMER</h5>
        <p class="speech mortimer">True; and thou seest that I no issue have <br>
        And that my fainting words do warrant death; <br>
        Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather: <br>
        But yet be wary in thy studious care. <br>
        RICHARD</p>

        <h5 class="name plantagenet">PLANTAGENET</h5>
        <p class="speech plantagenet">Thy grave admonishments prevail with me: <br>
        But yet, methinks, my father's execution <br>
        Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.</p>
